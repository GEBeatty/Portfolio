Does your program run without error: To the best of my knowledge, yes.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?: N/A

Additional comments to the grader:
When my program runs into a minimum spanning forest, it only replies with 
a statement saying the graph is not an MST, and prints no edges. Not sure 
if that's a big deal but I wanted to mention it just in case.
