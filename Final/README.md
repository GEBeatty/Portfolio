This was my final project for one of my programming courses. It is a social site called "Turn", and is meant to take after Craigslist, except instead of buying items, users rent items from one another.
Users are able to create a profile, and add items to their own profiles. They are also able to create and join groups, and select which items they would like which groups to see.
