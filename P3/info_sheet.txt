Assignment #: 3
Program due date: 3/21/19
Handed in date: 3/21/19
Source code file name(s): CarTracker.java
Other file name(s) (if relevant): N/A 
Does your program run without error: To the best of my knowledge, yes.
If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?: N/A
Additional comments to the grader:
My program checks VIN numbers for authenticity, but only in length. It 
checks if the user's entered line is equal to 17 characters, and it it's 
not, forces them to re-enter an appropriate-length VIN. It does not 
check for punctuation or special characters.
Also, when reading in the cars.txt file, my program skips the first 
line since it only contains the specified format for the rest of the 
information.
