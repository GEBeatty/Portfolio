Grace Beatty - Project 1

Approach

I utilized my existing DLB sort in order to create a history trie for the user.
It accepts a file, creates a trie, and then rewrites over the existing file to hold
the user's words as well as their frequency of usage. I figured this would be a good
structure to use as I already had it on hand, and it does well with storing spase
information

In addition, I utilized a website for assistance in implementing the Radix Sort
part of the program:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radix-sort/
With a Theta of NK sort time (considering number of elements and size of said elements),
I figured it would scale well if the history trie list were to ever get very large. In
this case, the sort would need to go through each of the found history elements, create
2 arrays based on those elements, find the positions of the first array (sorted frequencies)
and then put the frequencies and nodes in their respective spots in the array.
