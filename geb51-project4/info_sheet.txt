Additional comments to the grader:

I previously updated my category totals during the GET call to categories. Since that call modifies the data set, I figured it wasn't a safe GET, so I modified my code so my category totals update whenever I POST a new purchase or DELETE a category. It was largely a copy-paste job.
I did leave in the code in the GET request, but commented it out so it doesn't effect the function. In case something crazy DOES happen, un-commenting that section should make everything work again.
